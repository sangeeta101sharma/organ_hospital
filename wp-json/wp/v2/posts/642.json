There is no need to panic or be worried but it is good to know the different challenges as well so that we can do the timely intervention.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><strong>About Placenta Previa:<\/strong><\/strong> One pregnancy-related complication is Placenta previa. Placenta Previa is a  rare condition where the placenta of the baby covers the mother\u2019s cervix which is the outlet of the uterus. This can result in severe bleeding during pregnancy and delivery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><strong>Symptoms:<\/strong><\/strong> The primary symptom of Placenta Previa is red vaginal bleeding. In rare cases, there may also be contractions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><strong>Treatment:<\/strong><\/strong> In most cases, the doctor  detects the condition of Placenta Previa during the early stages of pf  pregnancy and resolve it accordingly. As the uterus grows, the distance  between the cervix and the placenta may increase. However, if more of  the placenta covers the cervix and the condition appears later in the  pregnancy then the problem is less likely to resolve. Normally the  doctor will advise bed rest during pregnancy. Activities like having  sex, using tampons or hectic activities can increase the risk of  bleeding. If the Placenta Previa does not resolve you may have to  undergo C-section.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Who are prone to have it:<\/strong> The condition is quite rare and very unlikely that you would have it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>However, the Following Observations were seen in most Cases:<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Have had an earlier pregnancy, especially through C-Section<\/li><li>There are scars in the uterus from different causes like previous C-sections fibroid removal surgery or any such forms of surgery.<\/li><li>There is a previous history of placenta previa<\/li><li>Aged above 35 years<\/li><li>Smoker or user of drugs like cocaine<\/li><\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Pregnancy is always a time for mixed emotions.
