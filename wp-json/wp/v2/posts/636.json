There  is a 55-60% chance that prostate cancer occurs around the age of 60-65  years. It is the fourth most common form of cancer after skin cancer  around the world. Treat it before it is too late by a <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/organhospital.com\/services\/urology\/\">urologist in west delhi<\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--more-->\n\n\n\n<p>A small gland that you can find in a man\u2019s lower abdomen is what we call the prostate. It falls below the bladder and surrounds the urethra. The prostate is responsible for the production of seminal fluid. The hormone testosterone regulates the process. Abnormal growth of cells on the prostate leads to the formation of the tumor. When this tumor grows malignant, it becomes cancerous. If you do not treat it on time, then this cancer can dangerously spread to the other parts of the body and affect other organs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Types of Prostate Cancer:<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Every type of cancer is of two kinds, and so is prostate cancer: aggressive and non-aggressive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Aggressive cancer:<\/strong> Aggressive  cancer is fast-growing cancer, and it spreads dangerously if you don\u2019t  treat it in time. It can even spread to the bones.depends<\/li><li><strong>Nonaggressive cancer:<\/strong> Nonaggressive cancer is cancer that does not grow or grows very little.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><strong> The Cause of Prostate Cancer:<\/strong><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no particular cause or reason for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/diseases-conditions\/prostate-cancer\/symptoms-causes\/syc-20353087\"><strong>prostate cancer<\/strong><\/a>.  It happens just like other cancers. It could be genetical, or exposure  to certain things can cause it.The risk factors are old age, family  background of prostate cancer, obesity, genetic changes, exposure to  certain chemicals, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><strong>Symptoms of Prostate Cancer:<\/strong><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The non-aggressive form of cancer does not show any signs at all. Aggressive prostate cancer can show some symptoms. These include urinary problems which are i)a frequent need to urinate, ii) a slower stream of urine, iii) hematuria, sexual issues like erectile dysfunction, impotence, other physical problems like pelvic pain, back pain, chest pain, and if it spreads in the spine you may lose the feeling of your lower abdomen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><strong>How To Diagnose Prostate Cancer:<\/strong><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The diagnosis and screening of prostate cancer is subjective to each case. Every individual needs a different type of diagnosis. If you see any symptom or if you have reached a certain age, then consult a urologist. Your urologist will suggest the right kind of screening and treatment if they see a risk of prostate cancer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a complete guide about one of the most common forms of cancers.
